Try to run an empty dart file, what did you get?

An error that says:

```
No `main` method found.
```

A `dart` program is only valid if it contains a `main` method. and the `main` method is the entry point of your program.

So let's define it:

```dart
void main() {

}
```

But what does mean? ðŸ¤” don't worry right now, we just have to know that:

1. Every `dart` program has a `main` method.
2. The `main` method is the entry point of our program.
3. How to define a `main` method.
