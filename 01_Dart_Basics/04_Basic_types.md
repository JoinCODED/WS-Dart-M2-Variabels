In the previous lesson we declared a variable with the `String` type, I bet you are wondering what other types we have in Dart.

The main basic types that you need to know are:

1. int
2. double
3. boolean
4. String

Let's see how to use them:

```dart
void main() {
    String name = 'Salem';
    int age = 24;
    double height = 1.78;
    bool lovesCoding = true;
}
```

Let's start with them one by one:

1. `int age = 24;` an `int` type is used for any number that doesn't have decimal places.
2. `double height = 1.78;` the `double` aka `float` is used for any number that has a fractional part.
3. `bool lovesCoding = true;` the `bool` aka `boolean` can be assigned two possible values, true and false.

### Challenge 👾: Can you spot the variable with the correct type?

```
int price = '200';
bool onSale = 'true';
double temp = 54.2;
```

### Solution 💡: 

```
int price = '200'; ❌
bool onSale = 'true'; ❌
double temp = 54.2; ✅
```
