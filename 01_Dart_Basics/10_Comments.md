There's a useful feature that you haven't learned yet, but maybe you've noticed it, it's a `comment`.

Comments are texts that can be injected into our code but ignored by the compiler.

Comments are useful to add notes 📝 to the code so you can understand it when you get back to the code after a long time, or for your colleague developer if you are working within a team.

### Single-line comments:

To add a single-line comment in Dart, we start the line by `//`:

```dart
void main(){
    // this is a comment that is ignored by the compiler
}
```

### Multi-line comments:

To add multiple lines of comments in Dart, we start the line by `/*` and we end it with `*/`:

```dart
void main(){
    /* this is a comment that is ignored by the compiler
    This is also a comment on another line
    the end of my precious comment */
}
```
