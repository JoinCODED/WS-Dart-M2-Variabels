We are going to write our first `dart` program! ü§©

Let's type the following code in our main `method`:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello World');
}
```

Run your code, you can see `Hello World` printed in the console!

This is called a `print` üñ®Ô∏è statement.

Let's add another `print` statement:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello World');
  print('My first Dart program');
}
```

Run your code, it will `print` what you asked it to `print` in the same order, because code is executed line by line from top to bottom.

What you need to know:

1. You can write your code in the `main` method.
2. `print`: Prints a string representation of the object to the console.
3. The code is executed line by line from top to bottom.
