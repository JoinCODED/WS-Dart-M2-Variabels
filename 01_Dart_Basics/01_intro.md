![dart-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84308096/157936704-06afe190-bb76-4fda-b97d-b13f6a294684.png)

Dart is the programming language behind flutter. It helps you develop on IOS, Android, Web and many others.

Programming languages are either fast in compile time, which means you can iterate and make changes on your code faster, and that makes your life as a developer easier.

Or fast in execution time compile, which makes the end user happy because the code gets compiled faster and improves the performance.

What's amazing about Dart, it has a (JIT) "just in time compiler" and an (AOT) "ahead of time compiler", which makes it ideal for both developers and end users.

Dart is the only language that enables this across all different platforms!

It is also:

- **Object Oriented**: Structure the code inside classes.
- **Statically Typed**: Helps us write code that is safe and more predictable.
- **C-Styled Syntax**: Similar to popular programming languages such as Java and JavaScript.
- **Easy To Learn**: You will find out! ðŸ˜‰
