There's a useful feature that you haven't learned yet, but you maybe noticed it, its `comments`.

Comments are text that can be injected in our code but ignored by the compiler.

Comments are useful to add notes 📝 on the code so you can understand it when you leave the code for a while, or for your colleague developer if you are working on a team.

### Single line comments:

To add a single line comment in dart we start the line by `//`:

```dart
void main(){
    // this is a comment that is ignored by the compiler
}
```

### Multi line comments:

To add a single line comment in dart we start the line by `/*` and we end it with `*/`:

```dart
void main(){
    /* this is a comment that is ignored by the compiler
    This is also a comment on another line
    the end of my precious comment */
}
```
